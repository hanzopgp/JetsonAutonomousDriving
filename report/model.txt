problems :

- what kind of gesture could be nice for our problem (signs must be very different for easier learning)
- what kind of background / distance etc... to have a nice train set in order to generalize
- what to use to train multiple model at a time so we don't waste time ?
- augmentation on train + valid ? augmentation only on train? what kind of augmentation is useful (e.g. color make it generalize but maybe you want to keep the color of the hand ?) ? valid set with backgrounds of photos never seen in train

- what layer to freeze ? (last layers of classifier / all classifier / all classifier + last layers of features)
- how many neurons on classifier layers ?
- what model to chose for transfer learning ?

- what to do in inference when there is no hand movement ? NONE class ? sigmoid output activation ?
- poor performance in inference comparing to validation set
