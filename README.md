# JetsonAutonomousDriving

## Objective :

The objective of this project is to explore the possibilities of NVIDIA's Jetson Nano card for real-time video processing. The idea is to develop a processing chain for the autonomous driving of a small robot-car.

## Requirements :

All the requirements and references are written at the root of the repository.

## Steps :

- Introduction :
  - Setup Jetson Nano card
  - Video/Image processing on Jetson Nano card
  - Setup RasberryPi with Jetson Nano card and the robot-car
  - Develop a software to control the robot-car
  - Code image/video processing module

- Driving :
  - Code video + steering angle getter
  - Code data augmentation
  - Code data preprocessing
  - Build deep learning model
  - Train, fine-tune, evaluate
  - Link actuators module and model

- Traffic signs :
  - Build traffic signs, pedestrian etc...
  - Take pictures
  - Label pictures with labelimg
  - Build classification model
  - Train, fine-tune, evaluate
  - Link actuators module and model
  - 
- Bonus :
  - Try reinforcement learning
