# JetsonAutonomousDriving

## Objective :

The objective of this project is to explore the possibilities of NVIDIA's Jetson Nano card for real-time video processing. The idea is to develop a processing chain for the autonomous driving of a small robot-car.

## Requirements :

All the requirements and references are written at the root of the repository.

## Steps :

- Setup Jetson nano card
- Video/Image processing on Jetson Nano card
- Setup RasberryPi with Jetson nano card and the robot-car
- Develop a software to control the robot-car
- Develop a software which control the robot-car thanks to computer vision
- Develop a deep learning model which control the robot-car
- Optimize model and add features such as STOP signs
- Try reinforcement learning
